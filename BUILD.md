# How to build Zeno from source

## Software requirements

To work with Zeno, you need:

```cpp
Git >= 2.0 && CMake >= 3.16 && Qt >= 5.12 && (MSVC >= 2019 || GCC >= 9 || Clang >= 11) && (Windows || Linux) && 64bit
```

### Windows

1. Download and install Git: https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.35.1.windows.2/Git-2.35.1.2-64-bit.exe

2. Download and install CMake: https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.21.3/cmake-3.21.3-windows-x86_64.zip
> Or you can install cmake and ninja by python-pip
```
pip install cmake ninja
```

3. Download and install Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition (which is free): https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/zh-hans/downloads/

> Note that we install Visual Studio **only to get the compiler bundled with it**. Feel free to use your favorite editors like VSCode or CLion other than Visual Studio for coding.

> It's recommended to install Visual Studio in trivial locations, like `C:/Programs Files (x86)/xxx` or at least `D:/Program Files (x86)/xxx`, so that VCPKG can find it easier.

> If you use VCPKG, you need to select the 'English Language Pack' when install, otherwise VCPKG will fail to work (it doesn't support Chinese characters in path).

4. Download and install Qt5 via their installer: https://download.qt.io/archive/qt/5.14/5.14.2/qt-opensource-windows-x86-5.14.2.exe

> Hint: Try this Tsinghua mirror if official site too slow: https://mirror.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/qt/archive/qt/5.14/5.14.2/qt-opensource-windows-x86-5.14.2.exe

> WARN: You must click the `Qt 5.14.2` option to install the prebuilt Qt binaries, otherwise only the Qt Creator is selected by default.

> JOKE: Yes, we have to register a Qt account to install Qt... because the Qt company sucks :)

5. If the install location is `C:\Qt\Qt5.14.2`, then please add `C:\Qt\Qt5.14.2\msvc2017_64\bin` to the `PATH` environment variable.

> This is to allow the `zeno.exe` being able to find `Qt5Widgets.dll` there. Otherwise you need to manually copy `C:\Qt\Qt5.14.2\msvc2017_64\bin\Qt5Widgets.dll` and other DLLs to `build\bin`. After this step rebooting the computer (or at least restart Visual Studio) would be best.

> JOKE: Because offcial Qt prebuilt binaries not matching VS2019, so we have to use `msvc2017_64` rather than `msvc2019_64`, it works too.

### Ubuntu

If you use Linux the setup would be much easier, simply run these commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y git cmake make g++
sudo apt-get install -y qt5-default libqt5svg5-dev
```

> NOTE: We highly recommend to use **Ubuntu 20.04 (or above)** whenever possible.

> NOTE: Try `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade` if installation failed.

#### If you want to use Ubuntu 18.04 anyway...

Ubuntu 18.04 users may have to install `Qt >= 5.12` from the official installer manually.

> As a contrast, Ubuntu 20.04 users can easily get Qt 5.12 by running `apt install qt5-default`.

Also note that the default GCC version of Ubuntu 18.04 is GCC 7, you may need to `apt install g++-9`
then add `export CXX=g++-9` in your `.bashrc` and restart the shell.

> As a contrast, Ubuntu 20.04 users have GCC 9 by default (which have full C++17 support for Zeno).

> We always prefer the latest version when possible, for all GCC, Qt, CMake...

### Arch Linux (recommended)

Arch Linux is the author's recommended environment, as it always provide latest version of packages.

```bash
sudo pacman -Syu
sudo pacman -S git cmake make gcc
sudo pacman -S qt5-base qt5-svg
```

> NOTE: We really recommend to use Arch Linux instead of Ubuntu if possible.

> JOKE: We support Ubuntu and Windows because they are popular, not because they are good.

### WSL

We haven't tested Zeno 2.0 on WSL (they doesn't have X11 by default). But please
[give feedback](https://github.com/zenustech/zeno/issues) if you meet trouble there,
we'd happy to help you resolve :)
My video about how to setup X11 in WSL1: https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1u44y1N78v

> We recommend to use native Windows instead of WSL, to prevent OpenGL and CUDA driver issues.
> Yes, **Virtual machines, WSL, and Docker**, are not recommended due to their poor GPU support.
> Using native Linux would be the best choice in my opinion.

### Mac OS X

Please refer to this video for installation guide :) https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1uT4y1P7CX

## Get source code

Now that development tools are ready, let's clone the source code of Zeno from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zenustech/zeno.git
cd zeno
```

> If you find GitHub slow: use `git clone https://gitee.com/zenustech/zeno.git` instead, which is our [official Gitee mirror](https://gitee.com/zenustech/zeno).

> May also try `git clone https://github.com/zenustech/zeno.git --depth=1` for only fetching the latest commit, to reduce transmit data size for faster clone.

## Build Zeno

Quickly recall our CMake knowledge in [my parallel course](github.com/parallel101/course):

1. The first step `cmake -B build` called *configure*, it generates the `build/` directory containing `Makefile`.
2. The second step `cmake --build build` called *build*, equivalant to `make -C build` on Linux and call MSBuild on Windows.

> JOKE: Fun fact, 99% CMake errors could be solved by `rm -rf build` :)
> So, if you meet CMake issues, try delete the `build` directory completely and re-run the above two steps. It may magically works again, hopefully.

### Windows

```bash
cmake -B build -DQt5_DIR="C:/Qt/Qt5.14.2/msvc2017_64/lib/cmake/Qt5"
cmake --build build --config Release
```

Please replace the `C:/Qt/Qt5.14.2` by your custom Qt install location. And make sure you use `/` instead of `\\`, since CMake doesn't recognize `\\`.

> The `--config Release` argument is **only required on Windows**, thank to the fact that MSBuild is a multi-config generator.
> If you use `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` in the *configure* phase, then you should also `--config Debug` in the *build* phase.

> Also, Windows doesn't support `--parallel` argument, which means MSBuild is a single-threaded build system, you have to wait.

> If the second command (`cmake --build build --config Release`) failed with `cannot find compiler 'cc1.exe'`: Please open the `build/zeno.sln` with Visual Studio, select `Release` configuration in the UI, click the `Build` button. (Yes, MSPigs prefer GUI than CLI... They never expose `cc1` to `PATH`... After `Build` complete, simply exit Visual Studio, and continue edit files with your favorite IDE :)

### Linux

```bash
cmake -B build
cmake --build build --parallel 4
```

> `--parallel 4` here means using 4 CPU threads.

## Run Zeno

After build, you will find all the EXE and DLL files in `build/bin` directory. Now simply run the `zenoedit.exe` in it:

### Windows

```cmd
build\bin\zenoedit.exe
```

### Linux

```bash
build/bin/zenoedit
```

This should shows up an node editor window if everything is working well.

## Building Zeno extensions (optional)

Zeno is a C++ project with thousands of `.cpp` files. However what you have just built is just some
hundreds of them. To build the full-featured version of Zeno, you need to *enable* the Zeno extension modules.

> Why not build the extension modules by default? Because they require a lot of dedicated setup, which can
> be unfriendly to new users. E.g., some of them depends on `x86_64` architecture, or the `CUDA` toolkit.

> We decide to keep **the core part of Zeno** build without any dependencies to **make it easy for new users**.
> People with dependencies installed may turn on some of the extensions manually if they'd like to.
> (In fact, the Zeno editor which requires Qt may also be turned off, building only the API of Zeno core).

If you are ready to challage, please go ahead to [`docs/BUILD_EXT.md`](docs/BUILD_EXT.md).
