Usage:
    SAX2Print [options] <XML file>

This program invokes the SAX2XMLReader, and then prints the
data returned by the various SAX2 handlers for the specified
XML file.

Options:
    -u=xxx      Handle unrepresentable chars [fail | rep | ref*].
    -v=xxx      Validation scheme [always | never | auto*].

    -x=XXX      Use a particular encoding for output (LATIN1*).
    -f          Enable full schema constraint checking processing. Defaults to off.
    -p          Enable namespace-prefixes feature. Defaults to off.
    -n          Disable namespace processing. Defaults to on.
