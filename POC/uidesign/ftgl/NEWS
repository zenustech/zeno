----------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Refactored FTGlyphContainer & FTCharmap. They now store FTGlyphs
      sequentially rather than by glyph index. This should save a heap
      of memory and a bit of time at startup.
    * Changed the Mac font paths in the demos.
    * Changed the unit tests for new hinter in Freetype 2.1.4.
    * Added a test for broken contour tags.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Fixed a long standing visual bug in FTVectoriser.
    * Changed size calculations to use floats instead of ints. This
      includes FTBBox.
    * Refactored FTGlyph. Now calculates advance (as a float) and
      bbox.
    * Changed contourList from FTVector to an array in FTVectoriser.
    * Made function and member names more consistant.
    * Moved header files to include directory.

    * Glyph loading has been optimised for pixel based glyphs.
    * Removed mmgr
    * Added FTFont::Attach
    * Updated API docs
    * Removed stl map and vector. Replaced by code supplied by
      Sebastien Barre

    * Inline some private functions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
--- 2002-04-23  Release 1.32                                       ---
----------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------
--- 2002-01-30  Release 1.31                                       ---
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Forgot to update readme etc for 1.3

----------------------------------------------------------------------
--- 2002-01-27  Release 1.3b5                                      ---
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    * FTBbox now uses float rather then int
    * Fixed some more warnings (size_t)
    * Removed the contour winding function because it didn't fix the
      problem!!
    * Fixed up some state settings in fonts.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
--- 2001-12-11  Release 1.3b4                                      ---
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Added MAC OSX project (Project Builder)
    * Added a function for extruded glyphs that calculates the winding
      order of the glyph contour.
    * Added FTGL_DEBUG to include memory debugger.
    * Added a couple of typedefs to FTGL.h, mainly to aid debugging
    * Cleaned up the includes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
--- 2001-11-13  Release 1.3b3                                      ---
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Texture fonts now behave the same as the others and can be
      loaded on demand. This made FTGLTextureFont MUCH simpler!!!! It
      has also improved the grid fitting so less texture mem is
      needed.
    * Refactored FTVectoriser...
      This now builds contours and meshes internally and then passes
      the raw point data onto the glyphs. The gluTess data is captured
      in an internal non static data structure fixing a memory Leak in
      PolyGlyph (glCombine).
      This has enabled...
    * Extruded fonts. FTGLExtrdFont & FTExtrdGlyph.
    * Reversed the winding for polyglyphs, extruded glyphs and texture
      glyphs to make them CCW
    * Bounding box function
    * Fixed the != and == operators in ftPoint
    * Un-virtualised some functions in FTFont
    * Added a demo app to dist.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
--- 2001-11-09  Release 1.21                                       ---
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Visual Studio projects updated for .cpp source file extensions.
    * A couple of windows 'cast' warnings have been fixed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
--- 2001-11-06  Release 1.2                                        ---
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Glyphs can now be loaded on the fly instead of being
      pre-cached. If FTFont::Open() is called with false,
      FTGlyphContainer will build a list of null pointers. Then when
      ever a glyph needs to be access eg by FTFont::advance or
      FTFont::render, it will be built and slotted into the glyphlist
      in the correct position.
    * Removed glext.h from FTGL.h and replaced it with a test for
      GL_EXT_texture_object.
    * Added padding to texture size calculations.
    * Fixed a NASTY bug in FTGLTextureFont. Only came to light after
      changes to the glyph preprocessing.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
--- 2001-10-31  Release 1.1                                        ---
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Renamed the source to .cpp
    * Removed the static activeTextureID from FTTextureGlyph and
      replaced it with a call to
      glGetIntegerv( GL_TEXTURE_2D_BINDING_EXT, &activeTextureID);
    * Added an include for glext.h in FTGL.h
    * Tidied up the glbegin/glEnd pairs in FTTextureGlyph &
      FTGLTextureFont
    * Fixed the problem with doc filenames.
    * Tidied up some implicit type conversions.
    * Fixed FTCharMap to ensure that a valid default charmap is always
      created by the c_stor.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
--- 2001-10-26  Release 1.01                                       ---
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Removed the glEnable( GL_TEXTURE_2D) from FTGLTextureFont
    * Removed the redundant tempGlyph members in the FTGLXXXXFont
      classes
    * Made a change in FTGL.h to include correct headers for MAC OSX
    * FTGL.h now includes glu.h
    * Minor fixes to get rid of Project Builder warnings (MAC OSX)
    * Fixed some of the docs

----------------------------------------------------------------------
--- 2001-10-24  Release 1.0                                        ---
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Version 1.0 release

----------------------------------------------------------------------
--- 2001-09-29  Release 1.0b7                                      ---
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Tesselation winding rules
    * Fixed bug in FTContour Add point function
    * Cleaned up disposal of FTCharmap in FTFace
    * renamed FTVectorGlyph to FTOutlineGlyph
    * New distribution structure
    * Minor changes for windows (VC 6)
    * Windows and Linux ports.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
--- 2001-09-20  Release 1.0b6                                      ---
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Implemented the new FTCharmap class. The performance improvement
      is dramatic.
    * Tidied up the way the freetype FT_Face object is disposed of by
      FTFont and FTFace. This was a potential crash.
    * FTVectorGlyph and FTPolyGlyph now disposes of the freetype glyph
      correctly after initialsation. This was a potential crash.
    * Preliminary support for unicode...wchar_t Tested with non
      european fonts.
    * Added function to calc the advance width of a string.
    * Minor tidy ups.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
--- 2001-08-29  Release 1.0b5                                      ---
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Settled on integers for FTSize stuff. NOTE the FTGlyph stuff is
      still up in the air.
    * Fixed the positional stuff.
    * Added Java Doc comments. NOT COMPLETE
    * Fixes for linux, mainly to clear warnings.
    * changed the return type for FTFace::Glyph() from a reference to
      a pointer so it can return NULL on failure.
    * Related to above...better error handling and reporting in
      FTGLXXXFont::MakeGlyphList()
    * Fixed a bug in FTVectoriser that was ignoring non printing
      characters. This meant that the pen wasn't advanced for spaces
      etc. It affected polygon and outline font rendering.
    * Minor tidy ups.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
--- 2001-08-21  Release 1.0b4                                      ---
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Changed the mode for FT_Load_Glyph to FT_LOAD_NO_HINTING |
      FT_LOAD_NO_BITMAP for outline and polygon fonts &
      FT_LOAD_NO_HINTING for texture fonts. Seems to produce better
      looking glyphs.
    * FTGLTextureFont can now use multiple textures to render glyphs
      if they  don't fit within one GL_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE texture.
    * Changed FTSize to use bbox for global width and height. Needs
      more work (eg float or int?) and need to check inconsistancies
      in freetype.
    * Being more strict with types eg integer indices and sizes are
      now unsigned.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
--- 2001-08-08  Release 1.0b3                                      ---
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    * I've made fundamental change to the way the glyphlist is
      built. This is to get round the problems I was having with
      charmaps. At this stage it is a temporary solution. Previously
      the glyphList was indexed by char code. Now it's indexed by
      glyph index and the conversion is done by the freetype function
      FT_Get_Char_Index(). If this proves to be too slow I'll make my
      own charmap and use it to index into the glyphlist. This has
      fixed all the charmap related problems/bugs.
    * Enabled alpha blend in Pixmap font.
    * Enabled LINE_SMOOTH in Outline font
    * Fixed bug that prevented the display of chars >127
    * Moved pixel store stuff out of BitmapGlyph into BitmapFont.
    * Minor changes for IRIX (compiles but isn't tested)
    * Pixmap fonts can now be in colour. It uses the current colour
      when the font is CREATED. This isn't ideal but is better than
      the alternatives.
    * Tidied up the error handling.
    * Minor code clean ups.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
--- 2001-08-06  BETA Release 1.0b2                                 ---
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Minor tidy ups for first public release.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
--- 2001-08-03  First BETA Release 1.0b1                           ---
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    * All font types are now working, Bitmaps, Pixmaps, Texture,
      Outline and Polygons. Quality of output and performance varies
      wildly. :)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
--- 2001-07-22  First ALPHA Release 1.0a1                          ---
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    * And so it begins.
